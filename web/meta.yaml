title: The Conquest of Ireland
author: Gerald of Wales
abstract: |
  Gerald of Wales (1146-1223), bishop of noble extraction, in his
  histories, left an account of the Norman invasion and conquest of
  Ireland.

  The Irish conquest was an extension of the conquest of Wales--an
  activity of Norman lords in the marches who were acting more or less
  independently of the crown.
